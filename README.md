# Fires-in-Australlia
This project consists of clear cut visualization of the Australian wild fire data and I've also created an interactive dashboard to analyse the data
# Australian Wildlife Fire Data Visualization and Dashboard

## Overview

This repository comprises Python code for visualizing Australian wildlife fire data over the years using popular data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium, and more. Additionally, an interactive dashboard has been implemented to analyze the data based on the year and region.

## Files

### 1. `australia_fire_visualization.ipynb`

This Python script includes code snippets to visualize Australian wildlife fire data using various Python libraries. Each library is utilized for different types of visualizations:

- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Static and dynamic visualizations to showcase trends and patterns.
- **Folium:** Geographical mapping for a spatial understanding of the data.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your specific requirements.

### 2. `australia_fires_dashboard.ipynb`

This file contains Python code to create an interactive dashboard for in-depth analysis of the wildlife fire data. The dashboard allows users to explore data based on the year and region, providing a user-friendly interface for comprehensive data exploration.

## Dependencies
